    <h2>Study Room</h2>
    <p>My proposed project is about reserving a study room in the library. 
    One needs to have Bhat&#39;s login id to use room booking services of the library. 
    There are 4 libraries in the town run by an organization called Bhat in Bylie town. 
    The names of the libraries are: East-L, west-L, north-L, south-L located in the 4 corners of the town.
     Each library has 50 rooms (10 rooms with capacity one person per room, 
     10 rooms with capacity 2 people per room, 10 rooms with capacity 4 people per room, 
     10 rooms with capacity 8 people per room, 10 rooms with capacity 15 people per room.</p>
